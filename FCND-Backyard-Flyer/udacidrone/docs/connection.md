title: Connection API Overview
sidebar_label: Overview
---

We have a `Connection` class that is really just an abstract class (depending on your background, you could also just think of it as an interface).  For each communication protocol our API wants to support, there needs to be a protocol specific class that subclasses the `Connection` class and implements all of the required functions in that protocol.

So really, when we say protocol independent, it's the `Drone` facing side of things that is protocol independent.  All the `Drone` attributes and functions that you would interact with when using UdaciDrone are protocol independent.  We achieve this by having our own set of attributes, etc, so each protocol needs to correctly parse messages and send information to the drone accordingly.

For example, with the mavlink protocol, things like global position and velocity are in the same message, but we have it broken out as two different attributes (and effectively two different internal messages -> from the connection class to the drone).

## Currently Supported Protocols ##

Currently, UdaciDrone supports the following communication protocols:

 - the [Mavlink Protocol](https://mavlink.io/en/) used in the [Dronecode](https://www.dronecode.org/) community.

 - [cflib](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python) the API used for [Bitcraze's crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/)

This means that this API currently works with the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases/tag/0.0.1) any [PX4](http://px4.io/) powered drone, and the crazyflie!.

There are some limitations on functionality of different drones, so not every connection will support all of the `Drone` functionality.  At the moment, these are the control commands that are supported:

Control Commands | Simulator | PX4 | Crazyflie
--- | --- | --- | ---
`cmd_attitude()` | yes | yes | yes
`cmd_attitude_rate()` | yes | yes | no
`cmd_velocity()` | yes | yes | yes
`cmd_position()` | yes | yes | yes
`takeoff()` and `land()` | yes | yes | yes

For those interested in extending the UdaciDrone API to support other protocols (e.g. Parrot or DJI), check down below for what methods need implementation!

## Messages ##

In order to have `Drone` be independent on the communication protocol, UdaciDrone uses an internal set of message names and types to pass data between a connection implementation and the `Drone`.

### Outgoing Message Types ###

Here is the set of available message names and the data they should carry.

Message Name | Data Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`MsgID.STATE` | `StateMessage` | changes in either the armed state of the drone or the control state (namely whether or not the drone is configured to take external commands from a script)
`MsgID.GLOBAL_POSITION` | `GlobalFrameMessage` | new GPS position of the drone
`MsgID.LOCAL_POSITION` | `LocalFrameMessage` | new local NED position of the drone
`MsgID.GLOBAL_HOME` | `GlobalFrameMessage` | new GPS home position of the drone
`MsgID.LOCAL_VELOCITY` | `LocalFrameMessage` | new velocity vector of the drone
`MsgID.CONNECTION_CLOSED` | n/a | connection to the drone has been terminated.  This means that attributes will no longer be updated and all drone facing commands will not be executed by the drone.
`MsgID.RAW_GYROSCOPE` | `BodyFrameMessage` | new raw gyroscope values
`MsgID.RAW_ACCELEROMETER` | `BodyFrameMessage` | new raw accelerometer information
`MsgID.BAROMETER` | n/a | new barometric pressured based altitude information
`MsgID.DISTANCE_SENSOR` | `DistanceMessage` | new distance measurement information (e.g. from onboard sonar or stereo vision sensors)
`MsgID.ATTITUDE` | `BodyFrameMessage` | new attitude information


## Abstract Methods ##

Here are all the abatract methods that must be implemented.  Note that while it must be implemented, not all implementations have to be functional (e.g. they can just `pass`).  The ones that are required to have functionality are marked as required in the table below:

Function Category | Required
--- | ---
Connection Management | yes
Vehicle Management | no
Vehicle Commands | no


### Connection Management ###

These are the set of commands that handle the management of the connection.

 - `open()` and `close()`
 - `start()` and `stop()`
 - `dispatch_loop()`


### Vehicle Management ###

These are the set of commands that handle managing the vehicle state.

 - `arm() and disarm()`
 - `take_control()` and `release_control()`
 - `set_home_position()`


### Vehicle Commands ###

These are the set of commands that actually control the drone.

 - `cmd_attitude()`
 - `cmd_attitude_rate()`
 - `cmd_velocity()`
 - `cmd_position()`
 - `takeoff()` and `land()`
